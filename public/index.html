        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p><strong>Vinyl</strong> (Music Recommender-Tool) is a semantic Web application able to "intelligently" recommend 
		    – by exposing a SPARQL endpoint – vinyl music records according to various criteria: user preferences 
			(specified via controlled natural language constructs such as "I always like/love/prefer classical music,
			especially opera music by Rossini or Verdi and performed by Angela Gheorghiu or Juan Diego Flórez; 
			I sometimes like progressive rock and post-rock; I like only metal albums released before 2000; 
			I always dislike/hate rap and hip-hop; I dislike songs produced by Flood in the last 25 years"), 
			past song purchases on various music stores, playlists – available online via music streaming services 
			Spotify and alternatives – and/or locally (i.e. uploading a JSPF/XSPF document). The playlists could be created 
			by the user or shared by her/his virtual "friends" (consider at least one social network). The system will use 
			several music-related knowledge models (e.g., Music Ontology or MusicRecording concept from schema.org) and available 
			public resources: Free Music Archive, MusicBrainz, Musicmoz Music Styles. Bonus: using Solid principles & tools.</br>
            The main shining features of Vinyl are: easy interlinked search through artists, songs, albums, genres and playlists, 
			lookup on different events related to the artists, create and manage playlists manually or generate "smart" playlists 
			through a series of keywords and the existing created playlists.

        <h2>Technologies</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><p><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">NodeJS</a> is an open-source server side runtime environment
                built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It provides an event driven, non-blocking (asynchronous)
                I/O and cross-platform runtime environment for building highly scalable server-side application
                using JavaScript.</p></li>
            <li><p><a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a> is a structural framework for dynamic web apps. It
                lets you use HTML as your template language and lets you extend HTML's syntax to express your
                application's components clearly and succinctly. AngularJS's data binding and dependency
                injection eliminate much of the code you would otherwise have to write. And it all happens
                within the browser, making it an ideal partner with any server technology.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Architecture</h2>

                <center>The general architecture of Vinyl-Recommender-Tool</center>
            </figcaption>
        </figure>


        <section id="use-cases">
            <h2>Use-Cases</h2>

            <figure typeof="sa:Image">
                <img src="public/resources/use_case.png">
                <figcaption>
                    <center>Use-Case diagram</center>
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                As we can observe in the diagram shown above, all of the MuSeR's features require the authentication of the user. The user can visualize the already created playlists. During the visualization, users will be able to edit them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another aspect of the application that can be observed in the diagram is the content finding mechanism. Users - for example - can find artists based on keywords specified by them. After finding the desired entity, he can select and add a specific song played by the respective artist into a personal playlist.
            </p>
            <p>
                Aside from this, the application will recommend other entities based on relationships of the visualized entity. (e.g. 'Songs from same artist', 'Songs from same Album' etc.)
            </p>

        <section id="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion & Future considerations</h2>
            <p>
                Vinyl-Recommender-Tool has been created to ease up the management of playlists for music enthusiasts by providing an intuitive platform that uses semantic Web concepts to enhance the
                way of visualizing the relationships between various entities in the context of musical domain. The application can be extended and improved in different ways by conceiving new mechanisms and architectural ideas such as media streaming or machine-learning-related suggesting mechanisms.
